Assignment 2
README

Brief description of the game developed 1/2 sentences:

  Meteor Run is a platform game inspired by Asteroids. Shoot the meteors to destroy them, and maybe collect bonuses. Don't crash your rocket into the meteors!


Known bugs/problems:

  The meteor is meant to bounce at the top and bottom of the screen - sometimes it fails to do this, and rolls along without moving up or down.


Keystrokes/Mouse:
  
  Move the rocket with the arrow keys or with this eight-key pattern which also allows diagonal movement:
        ↑
      Q W E 
    ← A + D →
      Z X C
        ↓
  Fire the laser by pressing S, Shift or Space.
